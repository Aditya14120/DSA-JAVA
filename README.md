# Data Structures & Algorithms — Java Solutions

Hi 👋
I’m consistently solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems in **Java** to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for Software Engineering roles.

This repository serves as a **public log of my learning journey** — every problem includes intuition, approach, and complexity analysis.

---

## 📌 Goals

* Strengthen DSA fundamentals
* Improve coding interview skills
* Write clean and readable Java code
* Build consistency through daily practice

---

## 🧠 What each solution contains

Each problem includes:

* Problem Link
* Intuition
* Approach / Pattern used
* Clean Java Code
* Time & Space Complexity

---

## 🚀 Why this repository exists

Many students solve problems but don’t document their thinking.
This repo focuses on **understanding patterns instead of memorizing solutions**.

---

## 🧩 Patterns I am focusing on

* Two Pointer
* Sliding Window
* Prefix Sum
* Binary Search on Answer
* Backtracking
* Greedy
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Traversal (BFS / DFS)
